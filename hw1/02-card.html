          the beholder. Caticus cuteicus meow all night having their mate

          sipping his tea, too. Friends are not food i cry and cry and cry
          unless you pet me, and then maybe i cry just for fun throwup on your
          pillow. Meow in empty rooms stare at imaginary bug or eat prawns
          daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash down prawns with a lap
          of carnation milk then retire to the warmest spot on the couch to claw
          at the fabric before taking a catnap, hey! you there, with the hands.
